These are the Perl notes, they're also used for documentation.

first things first, run this command to isntall the modules needed:
perl -MCPAN -e'install "LWP::Simple"' # found ou this is not required 
perl -MCPAN -e'install "Net::SCP"' # same goes for this one

a simple use of getopts should help us verify the options and the paramters
we passed in in the call.

a checker subroutine checks if the options match
